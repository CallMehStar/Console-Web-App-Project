    Also known as a terminal or computer console, a console is a combination of a display monitor and an input device, typically a keyboard and/or mouse.
    It allows users to input commands and receive visual output from a computer or computer system.
    The console does have some benefits, you can read input from users that is pretty difficult to do in the System class without some rigging, 
    (most people just import another class like Scanner for this)
     Console is good because for interactive console environments, like the repl, it combines all the features of a scanner or BufferedReader.
     Essentially a console is more beginner friendly, but you'll notice that you outgrow it the more you work on your own projects, in fact they're a pain to set up in IDE environments.
     To open the console, you first need to enable it through the settings menu.
    You can do this by clicking Options in the top right corner of the screen from the main menu, selecting Game Settings, and choosing Enable Developer Console.
     Set it to “yes.” The default key binding for the console is the tilde key (~).
     We can print messages to the console conditionally with console.log().
